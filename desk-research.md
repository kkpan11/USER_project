# Desk research

-----

At the start of our USER project members of the team gathered existing known critical literature on the topics of design, usability, OSS, and scientific software and the connections between these terms. We searched for literature and information that we were not currently aware of and added these into our desk research background information.

## Contributing to this list

No literature list is ever complete and this one was 'complete' in terms of the funded period of the USER project in October 2022. However, if you have a new piece of literature (papers or otherwise) please feel free to make a pull request on this markdown file and add a new peice of literature to the list. It helps us if you tage it in the table as 'unread' including the date of publicationa nd the date you added to this list. Additionally, please open up a discussion thread in our Github Discussions section with that piece of literature's title so that discussions can be had around it and how it feeds this work.
