# About this folder

Welcome to the folder where the markdown text files for our findings chapters are held.

Many of these chapters are works in progress (as of Mat 11th 2023) and have been write-up in progress since our research phase closed out in early March 2023. Given the work in progress nature of these chapters you may find they change and are updated as we finalise and refine our findings to meet the 'end of project' timeline.

This doesn't nessesarily mean that these chapters are complete in their contained information. We recognise in the spirit of open source contribution we're creating [discussion sections](https://github.com/simplysecure/USER_project/discussions/categories/findings-discussions) for each distinct chapter of dfindings.

Are criteria for merging changes to findings chapters are strictly and specifically related to inaccurate information or clarifying context and while we are interested in your opinions, perspectives and reflections we will not be merging any changes that are not 'corrections'. Our findings chapters are grounded in our reserach data which is not fully public due to respecting the privacy and security of our interview and survey participants. We cannot give open access to this data so that other contributors can make pull request changes for data-led additions or changes to the findings chapters.

Thanks for your interest and see you in the discussions!
