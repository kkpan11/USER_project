# People and Projects

Here's a WIP list of the people and projects involved in Science and Research OSS projects, institutions and initiatives that we identified pre-outreach efforts as potential participants in interviews, surveys and work around the USER project.

## Contributing to this list

Like much of the USER project work this is an iterative, evolving list of people and projects within the Science and Research ecosystem that are valuable as connectors and could provide critical insights into how design and usability is thought of and done in science and research OSS. 

If you'd like to contribute a person or project to this list then please make a pull request on this markdown file adding the projects. The projects added must have a name, link to a visible place on the internet to see their work described and they must be open source.
