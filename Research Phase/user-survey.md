## Contributing to this survey after March 2023

We welcome contributions to this survey after March 2023 in the form of:
1. Future responses to the survey as a participant (sans the stipend)
2. Discussion of survey structure, content and anonymous survey results in our [GitHub discussion thread](#)
3. Replication efforts by other design researchers looking at Science and Research OSS or another area of OSS (adaptions to survey welcome and we'd appreciate links back to us so we can view results)
4. Further analysis support of anonymous survey results, especially those that bring a new perspective/context to the results.
5. Translation into non-english languages would be welcomed so that we can gather insight from non-english speaking perspectives.

# Survey: Usability and Design in Scientific Open Source Software Projects

This is a 35 question, ~20 minute survey aimed at understanding how and why scientific open source software projects do/do not think about usability and design. We are looking for your perspective and experience working on scientific open source software projects, and are offering $15 USD (at time of survey published in Q4 2022) for your time. 


## About the Project

We at [Superbloom](https://superbloom.design/) (formerly Simply Secure) are researching how scientific open source software teams understand, consider, and undertake usability and design initiatives in their projects.

Our project is titled “Usable Software Ecosystem Research” or “USER” for short. We are investigating:

how norms in academic, science, and/or open source working environments affect the choices teams make around their users and different kinds of design interventions

how team dynamics and trust affects those choices

what teams would need to be interested in or able to prioritize usability in their work.

We will follow-up this survey with 30-50 hour-long interviews – if you are interested in participating in an interview, please complete the survey and indicate your interest at the end. Interviews will be compensated.

This research is(was) funded by the Sloan Foundation.


## Overview of the Survey

This survey has 35 questions and we anticipate that it will take ~20 minutes to complete. We will be compensating respondents with $15 USD in the form of a gift card (you can also opt to donate your honorarium). We will take your information so we can follow-up for the optional compensation at the end of the survey.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at [user-project@superbloom.design](mailto:user-project@superbloom.design).
