# Interview Guide and Script

----

Over the course of 2-3 months the USER research team, comprised of design researchers, OSS project managers and design practictioners, built this guide and suggested script informed by the previous ['desk research' activities](#).

## Interview intro

As you might know, our research concerns how ‘design’ and Usability are broadly thought about and practiced within scientific and research open source software projects and teams. Over the next 45 minutes to an hour, we’re going to ask a series of questions that help us to understand a number of key themes we’d identified in our preliminary research. The questions concern the people that build and contribute to that software and the structures that enable or support the software and people working on it. You’re welcome to skip any questions you don’t want to answer or stop the interview at any time for any reason. Do you have any questions before we begin?

### Intro questions

- What project do you work on primarily and what is your role?
- Is your project open source? From origin or from a certain date?
    - What is the effect of the project being an open source project?
    - Would you describe yourself as part of any communities/groups/movements and how would you describe those?
- What are the three most important values that drive the project?
    - What drives your contributions to the project? *(if a participant asks for clarification or seems confused, prompt with words like ‘You can think of them as values, motivations, inspires you etc.)*

### Users

- Who are the users of your project? *Alt wording: What kinds of people/professions use your project?*
    - Are many of your users also contributors to your project?
- What domain expertise do your typical users have? Do all users need that expertise?
- If at all, how do you get feedback from your users?
- How do you learn new things about your users?
- Are there any curious, odd, frustrating, or surprising user behaviors that you’ve noticed? Can you give an example?
    - What do you think users should do instead?
- How long would you say it takes a new user to learn to use your tool? What impacts that onboarding time?
    - Does that seem reasonable to you?
    - What would you need to change to make it easier/shorter?
    - Do you want to make those changes? Why or why not?
    - Case-by-case
        - Are there barriers to entry that in your opinion *benefit* the field or the tool, or act as a “filter” for users?
        - Alt: Are you inclined to change or address barriers to entry? Why or why not?
- What are the 3 most important tips would you give someone using your tool? *Subtext: What are the things people **do** to “hack” their projects/teams around design and usability?*
- What do you want to learn from your users?
- *cut if running low on time* Who are your *potential* user groups? In other words, what would enable new people to start using your tool and who would they be?

### Design

- What is the 1 largest problem that needs to be solved in project?
- What does “design” mean to you in the context of software projects? There is no right answer!
- Is “usability” a word that you and your team know and use?
    - If so: What does it mean to you? Is it important to your project for it to be usable?
    - If not: Is the ease of use of your project important to you and your team? Why or why not?
- How do you bring attention/capacity to issues you see in the project? / How are design and usability issues raised in your project?
    - Are design and usability issues or considerations addressed?
- How do design and usability questions get prioritized within your project compared to other issues or ideas?
    - What are the barriers, in your opinion, to design and usability getting more attention within your project?
- What design or usability problems does your project have, if any come to mind?
- What would addressing those issues achieve for your project and your team?
    - Who would benefit from improved usability / design of your project?
- [OPTIONAL] Imagine a designer joined your team. What do you think this would be like?
    - What could that person do in the next week?
    - What could that person do over the next year?
    - What might be difficult in working with a designer?
    - What might be difficult for the designer themselves in working in [project]?

### Project start & Institutional affiliation

- What is the “origin story” of the project? Where, why and how did it become what it is today?
    - Further questions if the participant needs prompting: Was there an inciting incident that started the project? Was it a surprise because it was a spontaneous discovery or an unintentional byproduct of other work?
- How is the project supported? Is it affiliated with any institutions or funding bodies?
    - Follow up: How do those relationships impact the work that your team does? For example, how does it impact how your project formulates goals and values, the workflow of your project, or the outcomes/”deliverables” of your work?
    - Are there pressures that come along with the affiliation?
    - Are there certain benefits?

### Groups of people, contributors

***[prioritize for people who do any kind of community engagement]***

- Has the group of contributors to your project changed over time? How so?
- Are there groups of people who are largely absent from contributing to the project? [might need some poking/inspiration of suggesting groups]
- Could you describe how your project onboards new contributors? How do people learn to contribute to the project in effective ways?
    - Are there specific skills, values, or contexts that help new contributors get started?
    - How are those things communicated?
    - What are the common challenges people have with onboarding to the project? Why? Do the challenges persist among certain groups?

### Values & the Future

***prioritize for people in decision-making capacity***

- Has the project ever experienced tensions amongst the team about big decisions? For example, opportunities that would influence the future of the project, like becoming commercial or getting funding from a certain corporation/organization?
    - How did you side in that tension? What informed your position?
    - How did others who held a different opinion argue for their position?
- In general, are there future scenarios for the project that you’re particularly wary of or concerned about?
    - Are there future scenarios you hope to achieve?
- What are events, occasions, or accomplishments that you celebrate as a project/community? What do you do at these events?
- What are jokes that people like to tell about the project?
- Anything else you’d like to share?

### Follow-up - If we didn’t get to all the questions

- Would you be willing to answer any questions we didn’t have time to address either through an additional interview, written responses, or record a video response?
