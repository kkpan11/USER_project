Hello!

We at Superbloom (formerly Simply Secure) are researching how scientific open source software teams understand, consider, and undertake usability and design initiatives in their projects. We seeking responses to our survey, which is an attempt to get a broad range of insights and opinions from the open source scientific software ecosystem.

Our project is titled “Usable Software Ecosystem Research” or “USER” for short. We are investigating:

  - how norms in academic, science, and/or open source working environments affect the choices teams make around their users and different kinds of design interventions
  - how team dynamics and trust affects those choices
  - what teams would need to be interested in or able to prioritize usability in their work.

This is a 35 question, ~20 minute survey aimed at understanding how and why scientific open source software projects do/do not think about usability and design. We are offering an optional $15 USD for your time via Tremendous gift card.

→ Access the survey here: https://tools.simplysecure.org/survey/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=117891&newtest=Y&lang=en

This research is funded by the Sloan Foundation. We will follow-up this survey with 30-50 hour-long interviews – if you are interested in participating in an interview, please complete the survey and indicate your interest at the end.

Thank you, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at user-project@superbloom.design with any questions.

Thank you,

USER team
