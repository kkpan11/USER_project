Below is an example of an email that the USER project have sent out to people and projects that would add useful, critical information to the [USER research projects goals](#). This text file serves two key functions:
1. To serve as an open, online template for anyone else interested in this research to review and use in the future.
2. To send to any participants that we do not have the email contact info for but do have an online method of contacting e.g. Twitter, Mastodon, Forums, Matrix chats etc.

## Subject: Invitation to contribute to research via 45 min interview: OS Scientific & Research Software Usability


## Body:
Hello {NAME},

Nice to e-meet you/Excited to reconnect with you - we/my colleague {NAME} met you at the {EVENT OR LOCATION NAME} at {TIME}.
I mentioned our current research on understanding how open source scientific and research software teams understand, consider, and undertake usability and design initiatives in their projects. (See more about the project + the interview project under headings below below.)

We are currently seeking participants for 45-minute, compensated interviews with our research team. If you are interested in participating, please use this [booking link](#) to find a time - let us know if you have any trouble, or if you can't see a time that works, reach out to the email ({EMAIL ADDRESS}) and we can coordinate a time.

### About the Project:
Our project is titled “Usable Software Ecosystem Research” or “USER” for short. We are investigating:

how norms in academic, science, and/or open source working environments affect the choices teams make around their users and different kinds of design interventions
how team dynamics and trust affects those choices
what teams would need to be interested in or able to prioritize usability in their work.
This research is funded by the [Sloan Foundation.](#)

### About the Interviews:

We are interested in speaking with a broad range of maintainers, developers, designers, scientists, researchers, funders, institutions and stakeholders – essentially, anyone who is involved with stewarding, supporting and/or creating open source scientific & research software.

Interviews will be 45-60 minutes, compensated at $50 USD in the form of a gift card. We will conduct the interviews over Zoom. Should you agree to interview, we will share a consent + reimbursement form which you must sign to participate. That form also includes information on how we handle data and privacy policies of the services we use. If you require language or translation services to be interviewed in a language other than English, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate.

Thank you,

{NAME} on behalf of the USER team
